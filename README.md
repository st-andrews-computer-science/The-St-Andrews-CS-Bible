This guide is here to help you write your CV, nail your technical interviews and ultimately receive internship and job offers from your dream work place!

If you are a student and want to intern or work in Technology, you will probably have already heard about the fact that it is a pretty specific field and, in order to get a job, you need to show a different set of skills and go through quite a different screening and interview process than someone who applies for a job in any other field.

The main goal of this guide is to help you, the students of St Andrews, discover new opportunities from your peers and St Andrews Computer Science alumni and learn how to approach and achieve a goal of getting a job in your desired company by improving your CV and practising solving problems which are typically offered in a technical interview.

The most important feature of this guide: you are more than welcome to add your own experiences, comments and opinions! We want this document to be a live and ever-growing helper created by people who can share their experience and knowledge!
