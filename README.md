## Welcome

<a href="#"><sub><sup>back to top</sub></sup></a>

This guide is here to help you write your CV, nail your technical interviews and ultimately receive internship and job offers from your dream work place!

If you are a student and want to intern or work in Technology, you will probably have already heard about the fact that it is a pretty specific field and, in order to get a job, you need to show a different set of skills and go through quite a different screening and interview process than someone who applies for a job in any other field.

The main goal of this guide is to help you, the students of St Andrews, discover new opportunities from your peers and St Andrews Computer Science alumni and learn how to approach and achieve a goal of getting a job in your desired company by improving your CV and practising solving problems which are typically offered in a technical interview.

The most important feature of this guide: you are more than welcome to add your own experiences, comments and opinions! We want this document to be a live and ever-growing helper created by people who can share their experience and knowledge!

### What is an internship?

An internship is usually a temporary job position which can last from just several weeks to a couple of years. Most of the internships in Computer Science are paid (unlike other areas!).
Why do companies hire interns?

Internships give both companies and young professionals a chance to get to know each other better. The students get experience in a certain company before applying there for a full-time position and, therefore, they have time to learn what it is really like working in that company and in that area in general. The companies, on the other hand, get to know you better and can make a very informed decision whether you have the right skills, potential and mindset to earn a full-time position. Internships are their way to invest in future workforce, diversify the workplace, minimise training and development costs and fast-forward the recruitment process.
Are there entry requirements for internship positions?

In major companies, the number of applicants per intern place is probably similar, if not higher, than the competition per full-time position. Normally, companies will have some eligibility criteria for the incoming interns. For example, some internships will be only open to current students in their penultimate year of studies and will normally happen over the summer while the others are only open to graduate students.

### Why should I do an internship?

There are tons of reasons why you should do an internship. First, it provides you with an immense amount of experience which is impossible to get directly from academia. In addition to that, it drastically improves your CV which you will use to get full-time jobs after you graduate from university.

Also, an internship gives you a better insight of how the company or an industry in general operates. You get to learn about what projects they work on, technologies they use, their work culture etc. Sometimes an internship can change your opinion about a company so much that it will affect the choice of your graduate position!

Another advantage is the fact that if you perform well during your internship, the company might give you a job offer, which in some cases makes it much easier to get a job offer using an internship as a stepping stone rather than directly applying for a graduate position.
